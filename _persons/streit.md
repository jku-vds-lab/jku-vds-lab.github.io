<p>I am a tenured Full Professor at the <a href="http://www.cg.jku.at">Institute of Computer Graphics</a> at <a href="http://www.jku.at">Johannes Kepler University Linz</a>, leading the  <a href="http://jku-vds-lab.at">Visual Data Science Lab</a>.
I completed my PhD at <a href="http://www.tugraz.at">Graz University of Technology</a> in 2011. During my tenure track at JKU, I was a Visiting Researcher at the <a href="https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/">Department of Biomedical Informatics</a> (DBMI) at Harvard Medical School in 2012 and served as a Visiting Professor at at the <a href="http://vcg.seas.harvard.edu">Visual Computing Group</a> at the <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu">Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> in 2014, supported by a Fulbright scholarship. Between 2012 and 2023, I was a guest lecturer at the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school">Imperial College Business School</a>.</p>

<p>My research focuses on <b>biological data visualization, visual analytics, and explainable AI</b>. Together with my team and collaborators, I develop novel visual analysis tools for drug discovery, manufacturing, and other application domains. I am leading research projects funded by FWF, FFG, and industrial partners. I am a key researcher in the COMET K1-Centre <a href="http://pro2future.at">Pro2Future</a>. In 2016, I co-founded the JKU spin-off company  <a href="http://datavisyn.io">datavisyn</a>, where I currently hold the position of Chief Strategy Officer.</p>

<p>I received best paper and honorable mention awards at major conferences, including IEEE VIS and CHI. I was a co-author of the <a href="https://communities.springernature.com/posts/data-visualization-a-view-of-every-points-of-view-column">Nature Methods Points of View</a> column. I actively contribute to the scientific community by serving on the organizing and program committee of several scientific events. I was general chair of the <a href="http://www.visualdatascience.org/">IEEE Visualization in Data Science</a> symposium and general chair of <a href="http://biovis.net">BioVis</a>, the Symposium on Biological Data Visualization.</p>
