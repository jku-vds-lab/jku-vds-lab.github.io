I'm a postdoctoral researcher and University Assistant in the Visual Data Science Lab.
My research focuses on bringing techniques from visualization and machine learning together.
I am especially interested in dimensionality reduction and explainable AI.

My PhD project was a collaboration with [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/).
As a part of that project, I spent one year at the [Biomedical Image Analysis (BioMedIA) group](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at Imperial.
I finished my PhD in December 2022 with my thesis on [Visual Explanations of High-dimensional and Temporal Processes]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/2022_phd_thesis_hinterreiter/).

I received my Masters degree in Technical Physics at [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://www.jku.at/en/), working on the structural and chemical analysis of surfaces.
As I had grown increasingly interested in machine learning, visualization and graphic design, I decided to transition to visualization research for my PhD.
