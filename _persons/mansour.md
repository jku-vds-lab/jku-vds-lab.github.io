I am a Project Assistant at the Visual Data Science Lab within the Institute of Computer Graphics at Johannes Kepler University Linz. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering and a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, with my master's thesis focusing on reinforcement learning. My research interests lie in the development of reliable and trustworthy AI systems, particularly in the areas of language models and computer vision.

In the Visual Data Science Lab, I primarily collaborate with our industry partner Voestalpine, where we focus on developing reliable AI tools to support data-driven decision-making. Our projects aim to enhance the interpretability and efficiency of their workflows by creating robust systems that help them better understand their data and perform tasks more effectively.
